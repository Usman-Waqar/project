Military Expenditure vs. Global Conflicts
📌 Motivation
Military spending is a crucial aspect of national security and geopolitical strategy. Understanding how military expenditure fluctuates in response to global conflicts can provide insights into defense policies, economic trade-offs, and international relations.

I have always been deeply interested in geopolitics, global conflicts, and history. I closely follow current conflicts to stay informed about global events. This project is a reflection of my curiosity about how military budgets evolve in response to wars and geopolitical tensions.

🎯 Goal
This study aims to analyze the relationship between military spending and global conflicts. Specifically, it investigates whether military budgets tend to increase before, during, or after major wars and geopolitical tensions.

❓ Research Questions
This project seeks to answer the following key questions:

1️⃣ How does military expenditure fluctuate in response to global conflicts? Is there a pattern in spending before, during, or after conflicts?

2️⃣ Do countries involved in prolonged conflicts exhibit sustained increases in military budgets compared to those experiencing short-term conflicts?

3️⃣ Are there regional differences in military spending trends related to geopolitical tensions (e.g., Middle East vs. Europe vs. Asia)?

4️⃣ Can historical data on military spending and conflicts be used to predict future military expenditure trends?

📊 Data Sources
The project relies on two primary datasets:

1️⃣ Military Expenditure Dataset
📌 Source: Military Expenditure by Country (1970-2020) - Kaggle
📌 Description: Contains military spending data for various countries over five decades. It includes military expenditure as a percentage of GDP and government spending.

2️⃣ Conflict Dataset
📌 Source: Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP)
📌 Description: Provides detailed records of armed conflicts, including start and end dates, severity, and involved nations. This dataset helps analyze military spending trends in relation to conflict occurrences.

📥 Data Collection Plan
🔹 Military Expenditure Data

Extract military spending data by country and year.
Adjust for inflation (if needed) for accurate comparisons.
🔹 Conflict Data (UCDP)

Identify years when conflicts occurred for each country.
Categorize conflicts by intensity (e.g., low-intensity conflicts vs. full-scale wars).
🔹 Data Merging & Analysis

Combine military expenditure data with conflict data to identify spending trends before, during, and after conflicts.
📊 Data Analysis Process
The project follows these key phases:

1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
✔️ Handle missing or inconsistent data.
✔️ Standardize monetary values for accurate comparisons.

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📌 Trend Analysis:
🔹 Visualize military spending trends across different decades.
🔹 Compare spending during peacetime vs. wartime.

📌 Regional Analysis:
🔹 Identify regions with the most significant spending fluctuations due to conflicts.

📌 Country-Specific Case Studies:
🔹 Analyze military budgets of key nations involved in long-term conflicts (e.g., U.S., Russia, Middle Eastern nations).

3️⃣ Statistical Tests & Correlations
📌 Conduct hypothesis tests to determine whether military spending significantly increases before, during, or after conflicts.
📌 Correlate the intensity of conflicts (e.g., casualties, duration) with military expenditure growth rates.

📈 Expected Findings
🔹 Military spending likely spikes before or during major conflicts as countries prepare for war.
🔹 Some nations may maintain high defense budgets post-conflict due to prolonged security concerns.
🔹 Regions with frequent conflicts (e.g., Middle East, Eastern Europe) may show more volatile military budgets.
🔹 Economic constraints may limit military spending, even during high-conflict periods, in some developing nations.

⚠️ Limitations
⚠️ Secretive Military Budgets: Some nations do not disclose full military spending (e.g., Cold War arms race projects).
⚠️ Complex Causal Relationships: Military budgets are influenced by multiple economic and political factors, not just conflicts.
⚠️ Scale & Nature of Conflicts: Wars vary in intensity, duration, and geopolitical impact, making direct comparisons difficult.

🚀 Future Work
🔹 Predict future military spending trends based on past conflicts.
🔹 Analyze alliance-driven spending (e.g., NATO-related budget increases).
🔹 Investigate the impact of nuclear deterrence policies on military budgets.
