# **Military Expenditure vs. Global Conflicts**

## **Motivation**  
Military spending is a crucial aspect of national security and geopolitical strategy. Understanding how military expenditure fluctuates in response to global conflicts can provide insights into defense policies, economic trade-offs, and international relations.  

I have always been deeply interested in geopolitics, global conflicts, and history. I closely follow current conflicts to stay informed about global events. This project is a reflection of my curiosity about how military budgets evolve in response to wars and geopolitical tensions.

## **Goal**  
This study aims to analyze the relationship between military spending and global conflicts. Specifically, it investigates whether military budgets tend to increase **before, during, or after** major wars and geopolitical tensions.

## **Research Questions**  
This project seeks to answer the following key questions:  

1️ **How does military expenditure fluctuate in response to global conflicts?** Is there a pattern in spending before, during, or after conflicts?  
2️ **Do countries involved in prolonged conflicts exhibit sustained increases in military budgets** compared to those experiencing short-term conflicts?  
3️ **Are there regional differences in military spending trends** related to geopolitical tensions (e.g., Middle East vs. Europe vs. Asia)?  
4️ **Can historical data on military spending and conflicts be used to predict future military expenditure trends?**

## **Data Sources**  
The project relies on two primary datasets:  

### **Military Expenditure Dataset**  
*Source:* [Military Expenditure by Country (1970-2020) - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasertk/military-expenditure-by-country-from-19702020)  
*Description:* Contains military spending data for various countries over five decades. It includes military expenditure as a percentage of **GDP** and **government spending**.  

### **Conflict Dataset**  
*Source:* [Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP)](https://ucdp.uu.se/)  
*Description:* Provides detailed records of armed conflicts, including **start and end dates, severity, and involved nations**. This dataset helps analyze military spending trends in relation to conflict occurrences.

## **Data Collection Plan**  
🔹 **Military Expenditure Data**  
- Extract **military spending data** by country and year.  
- Adjust for **inflation** (if needed) for accurate comparisons.  

🔹 **Conflict Data (UCDP)**  
- Identify **years when conflicts occurred** for each country.  
- Categorize conflicts by **intensity** (e.g., low-intensity conflicts vs. full-scale wars).  

🔹 **Data Merging & Analysis**  
- Combine **military expenditure** data with **conflict data** to identify spending trends before, during, and after conflicts.  

---

## **Data Analysis Process**  
The project follows these key phases:  

### **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
Handle **missing or inconsistent data**.  
Standardize **monetary values** for accurate comparisons.  

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
**Trend Analysis:**  
🔹 Visualize **military spending trends** across different decades.  
🔹 Compare spending **during peacetime vs. wartime**.  

**Regional Analysis:**  
🔹 Identify regions with the **most significant spending fluctuations** due to conflicts.  

**Country-Specific Case Studies:**  
🔹 Analyze military budgets of key nations involved in long-term conflicts (e.g., **U.S., Russia, Middle Eastern nations**).  

### **Statistical Tests & Correlations**  
Conduct **hypothesis tests** to determine whether military spending significantly increases **before, during, or after** conflicts.  
Correlate the **intensity of conflicts** (e.g., casualties, duration) with **military expenditure growth rates**.  

---

## **Expected Findings**  
🔹 Military spending likely **spikes before or during** major conflicts as countries prepare for war.  
🔹 Some nations may **maintain high defense budgets post-conflict** due to prolonged security concerns.  
🔹 Regions with frequent conflicts (e.g., **Middle East, Eastern Europe**) may show **more volatile** military budgets.  
🔹 Economic constraints may **limit** military spending, even during high-conflict periods, in some **developing nations**.  

---

## **Limitations**  
**Secretive Military Budgets:** Some nations **do not disclose** full military spending (e.g., Cold War arms race projects).  
**Complex Causal Relationships:** Military budgets are influenced by **multiple economic and political factors**, not just conflicts.  
**Scale & Nature of Conflicts:** Wars vary in **intensity, duration, and geopolitical impact**, making direct comparisons difficult.  

---

## **Future Work**  
🔹 **Predict future military spending trends** based on past conflicts.  
🔹 Analyze **alliance-driven spending** (e.g., NATO-related budget increases).  
🔹 Investigate the impact of **nuclear deterrence policies** on military budgets.
